# HIVE - iOS Screening Test

This repository showcases my implementation for the Hive iOS Screening Test. The iOS project includes a `UITableView` in `MainViewController` with a header displaying "Results." The custom table view cell dynamically adjusts its height, presenting an image on the left and a title/subtitle on the right.

## Features

- **Dynamic TableView:** Utilizes a `UITableView` to display search results with a header indicating "Results."

- **Custom TableViewCell:** Implements a custom cell with dynamic height, presenting images, titles, and subtitles.

- **Wikipedia API Integration:** Leverages the Wikipedia API for autocomplete search based on user input.

- **Autocomplete Search:** Dynamically updates search results as the user types in the integrated `UISearchBar`.

- **Image Visibility Control:** Adjusts image visibility within the cell based on API responses.
